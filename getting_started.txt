Getting started with GSN

1. Installing GSN

You first need to install GSN.
You can either install the binary distribution or build from the source code.
Both methods are explained here: https://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/gsn/wiki/Download

2. How to start GSN

Once GSN is installed, you can start it like this:

    If you have installed the binary distribution, use the batch file (Windows) or shell script (Linux).
    If you have downloaded the source code, use the ANT target: ant gsn

3. Loading your first virtual sensor

To load a virtual sensor into GSN, you need to mode its description file (.xml) into the virtual-sensors directory.
This directory contains a set of samples that can be used.

You can start by loading the MultiFormatTemperatureHandler virtual sensor (virtual-sensors/samples/multiFormatSample.xml).
This virtual sensor generates random values without the need of an actual physical sensor.
